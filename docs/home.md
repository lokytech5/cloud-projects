# Cloud Architecture Project for Standard International College

Welcome to the detailed documentation and demonstration of the cloud architecture project for Standard International College.

Standard International College is a high school located in the heart of Lagos State, Nigeria. The high school plans to transition its operations to the cloud, enabling students to access their academic performance and results online. This project ensures that staff can manage their duties efficiently while maintaining secure access control to various facilities. As cloud architects, it is our task to understand the requirements before starting the implementation.

## Requirements
- Secure user authentication and access control for students, teachers, and administrative staff.
- Scalable and reliable hosting for the school's web application.
- Secure data storage for student records and academic results.
- Analytics and reporting for student performance.
- Cost-effective and optimized use of AWS resources.

## List of Services
- **AWS Cognito**: User authentication and access control.
- **AWS EC2 / Elastic Beanstalk**: Hosting the web application.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions for backend processing and APIs.
- **AWS RDS**: Database management for student records.
- **AWS S3**: Storage for static files.
- **AWS Glue and QuickSight**: Data analytics and reporting.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and delivery.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning resources.

## Key Features
- Detailed architecture design.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation.
- API documentation for application functionality.
- Security measures for protecting sensitive data.
- Monitoring and logging setup.
- Cost management and optimization strategies.
